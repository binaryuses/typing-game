# python-typing-game
My first ever python program. I like python so far and can't wait to see what I can make next.

# how to play
run it and type "start" to play!

# how to adjust settings
change the <i><b>timer</b></i> variable to make it easier/harder to play!

you can add and remove words in the <i><b>words</b></i> from the words table

# other
any tips/contributions would help, I am still a beginner to python.
